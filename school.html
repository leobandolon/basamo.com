<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>“School Farm’s Newest Sensation”</b></font><br>
By: Marielle Stella C. Pandanduyan<br>

<p align="justify">
On the outskirts of school farm found in Hacienda Ricky, where rows of vegetables basked in the golden sunlight, there was an extraordinary squash named Raymond. Raymond was no ordinary vegetable; he had the unique ability to talk. His bright orange skin and cheerful actions made him stand out among the other vegetables in Sagay City Eco-Zone's school farm.<br><br>
Raymond loved the daily chatter of the farm, listening to the rustle of leaves, the song of the birds, and the laughter of the farm animals. However, he harbored a secret desire to explore the world beyond the vegetable patch. One day, as Farmer Lance inspected the crops, Raymond saw his chance.<br><br>
"Good day, Farmer Lance!" Raymond exclaimed, his voice surprising the young farmer.<br><br>
"Gracious me, did you just... talk?" Farmer Lance stammered, wide-eyed.<br><br>
"Indeed, I can talk, and I've always dreamed of seeing the world beyond the farm," Raymond confessed, his leafy tendrils quivering with excitement.<br><br>
Farmer Lance, with a chuckle, decided to grant Raymond's wish. He carefully plucked the talking squash from the vine and placed him in a wicker basket. Raymond, thrilled by the adventure, couldn't stop chattering as Farmer Lance carried him to the bustling town market in Brgy. Paraiso.<br><br>
As they entered the market, Raymond marveled at the variety of sights and sounds. The vibrant stalls, the bustling crowd, and the aroma of freshly baked bread fascinated him. Passersby were astonished to hear a squash carry on a conversation, and soon, a small crowd gathered around Farmer Lance and his talking vegetable.
