<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>The Lost and Found Daughter</b></font><br>
By: Marielle Stella C. Pandanduyan<br>

<p align="justify">
In a very promising and progressing farm of Eco-Zone, Nong Bongbong has been so dedicated in serving and working as utility and school guard at the same time. He was simply living with his family. Among his four children, he was very closed to his two daughters namely Bambam and Loraine.<br><br>
	Bambam and Loraine were used to be so closed with each other. Since kindergarten until they finished elementary, they were often mistaken as twins because they almost looked the same in many things. They loved to dress up in pair, do many things together, laugh and cry in the same matter, and many more. Almost perfect as they were described by the people surround them, but not until they reached high school. They often argued even in small things especially they began competing from the attention of the people they loved. Loraine always wanted to get whatever she demanded yet Bambam was often sided by their parents because of her good heart and valid reasons.<br><br>
	One day, Loraine couldn’t bear the burden anymore. She planned to go away from her home. She talked to her father and asked big amount of money. Nong Bongbong who has been so meek and softhearted gave all his savings that were intended supposed to be for the educational expenditures of his children for college. Then Loraine vanished from their sight.<br><br>
	Outside her parent’s care, Loraine experienced all sorts of worldly pleasure. She spent everything she has carried in her pocket, and even consumed her time with her spoiled lost friends. She already stopped schooling. She preferred going out and wasting life, and that made her lost too.<br><br>
	One gloomy night, Loraine felt empty and alone. She got sick. No one was attending to her. She’s hungry that even the foods she vomited she wanted to eat. Then she remembered her life back on their home. She never experienced such misery even they’re not wealthy. She realized all her mistakes and felt like hugging all her family. She badly missed them. Then, she made a plan. Tomorrow she will go home.<br><br>
	Early in the morning, while Loraine was nearly approaching to the farm of Eco-Zone where her father was doing his early routine, she was mumbling the words that she would want to say to his father and family. She practiced an apology many times until she became surprise and couldn’t utter anything because her father was already in front of her with a big smile and teary eye hugging her with all the love and excitement.<br><br>
	“I’m glad you’re here now”, her father sincerely said. Then her family who was supposed to bring breakfast to their father saw them and they all hugged each other. They ended their day with a celebration showing so much joy that their daughter was once lost and now is found and at home again. Of course, Loraine and Bambam get reconciled. Because for them sisters will always be sisters, no one can set apart the bond from their heart.
